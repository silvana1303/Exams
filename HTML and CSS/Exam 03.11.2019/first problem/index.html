                        Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life
                        According to radiometric dating and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago.
                        Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational 
                        interaction between 
                        Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
